Your PR need to pass at least the test for Linux on Travis CI. After the automatic test passes, some of the core developers will start reviewing your code. Note that this automatic PR test only includes CPU tests."

It is also preferable to briefly explain the specification of the function in a short paragraph, and refer to the corresponding function in NumPy so that users can read the detailed document. However, it is possible to include a complete copy of the document with such a remark if users cannot summarize in such a way."
